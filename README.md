# Week 2: How to Build "Buy Me a Coffee" DeFi dapp
# Alchemy's RoadToWeb3 

In this project, a decentralized smart contract "Buy me a coffee" was implemented that allows visitors to send you (fake) ETH as tips and leave nice messages, using Alchemy, Hardhat, Ethers.js and Ethereum Goerli.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
